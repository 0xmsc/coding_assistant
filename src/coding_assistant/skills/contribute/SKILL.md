# Contribute Skill

## Commits
1. Review `git status` and `git diff --staged`.
2. Write a short, clear summary (max 50 chars).
3. One logical change per commit.

## Pull Requests
- Keep PRs focused and reviewable.
- Link related issues if applicable.

### PR Template
```
## Summary
- <Context and purpose>
- <e.g. why, what problem, etc.>

## Changes
- <Change 1>
- <Change 2>
```

## Limitations
- No interactive commands (`git add -p`, `git rebase -i`).
- No force pushing or amending without explicit user guidance.
- Always confirm before final commit/push.
